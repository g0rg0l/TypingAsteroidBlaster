## Installing
To install the game, just download the `.jar` archive from the latest release to your device

## Running on Mac | Windows | Linux
After you have installed the compiled version of the program, you just need to run it using the java JRE installed on your device using the following command from terminal: `java -jar [jar_name].jar` from the directory with the pre-installed game.

_Important! Your device must have java JRE/JDK version 20.0.2 or higher installed_

## Background
In a galaxy far, far away... Your spaceship flies past a large cluster of asteroids, which, by an unfortunate coincidence, have an opposite magnetic field to the material from which your transport is made.

Itâ€™s good that it has a powerful weapon that can destroy them on approach. You just need to enter the correct code to destroy every asteroid that comes your way.

## Interface description
- The codes are presented in *Cyrillic*. Perhaps variations of this item will be added in the future.
- At the moment you enter the code, your sight is fixed on the asteroid whose code you enter; if you make a mistake, the sight flies off the target. You can also remove the sight yourself by pressing `ESC`.
- The player can vary the speed at which asteroids fall, their number, and the type of appearance directly in the game menu.
- You can also vary the volume of the sound (so as not to distract those who are very concentrated :D)
